I developed a regression artificial intelligence model that I trained with the resnet50 CNN structure on human data of all ages between the ages of 0 and 100. In this model, the dlib structure, which detects the faces in the camera by using the dlib structure, allows us to crop the faces and give the data as input to the model. I developed a project that detects faces in real time with this model and estimates the age of the face it detects.
